0068_WBL0061	And to those who don't even know their crimes, not even that.
0197_WBL0062	But will Posada be given up?
0948_WBL0065	The hope may be that Posada can soon be offered to a post-Chavez Allawi-like puppet in Caracas.
0385_WBL0067	But Posada's nearly 80 years old, and the Venezuelan people will ensure that's a vain hope.

0363_WBL0136	And you search in vain to find just one law abiding citizen
0244_WBL0138	Afraid I don't have time today to discuss these, but some stories need attention:
0215_WBL0141	Some 200,000 guns the US sent to Iraqi security forces may have been smuggled to terrorists, it was feared yesterday.
0642_WBL0143	But the four planeloads of arms have vanished.
0192_WBL0145	But the work was contracted out via a complex web of private arms traders.
0652_WBL0150	American defence chiefs hired a US firm to take the guns, from the 90s Bosnian war, to Iraq.
0047_WBL0182	The will is another matter.
0740_WBL0206	No need to worry.
0492_WBL0212	Then, of course, there is the evidence the jury did not hear about in the Robinson case ...
0062_WBL0228	no one was charged for forced marriage, only the beating.
0529_WBL0241	A country deserves the leaders it has, my friends ...
0073_WBL0242	And MEK  - the Iranian (not Iraqi)  terror group in question  - is itself unquestionably a cult:
0169_WBL0267	"Another generation of heavy metal has taken over, and  - sorry  - it ain't just about strippers and dope.
0867_WBL0268	Okay, it's partly about strippers and dope.

0955_WBL0285	They were death metal brainwashed fans, literally fulfilling the death metal paradigm, er ... morality.
0773_WBL0288	I detect the hissing lisp of the lying serpent in this article.
0652_WBL0290	I think the jury's still out on exactly who did the brainwashing when in regard to the Columbine killers.
0764_WBL0300	Imaginary evil is romantic and varied; real evil is gloomy, monotonous, barren, boring.
0843_WBL0324	During this search, Michele Tollis became convinced that satanism had something to do with his son's disappearance.
0095_WBL0362	Why don't you state it?
0881_WBL0365	John Balance from Coil.
0297_WBL0382	I was amazed at the spiel they delivered.
0929_WBL0406	I'm wary of jumping into this fray without backup, that's for damn sure. :)
0268_WBL0412	Similarly, is invoking ancient Egyptian gods and goddesses a reaffirmation of an oppressive and hierarchical system?
0077_WBL0419	A bit of a knee-jerk reaction from me there, and I apologize for my over-generalizations.
0488_WBL0444	I'm just speculating now.
0457_WBL0450	It's on loan, by the way, from a guy named JoeO'Neill in Midland, Texas.
0505_WBL0459	That's a Senate term  - particularly on good judges.
0779_WBL0470	And I gave it all my heart, all my energy, based upon principles that did not change once I got into the Oval Office.
0445_WBL0490	Russia also announced that it was seeking and building the best nukes the world's ever seen.
0523_WBL0491	President Vladimir Putin said Russia is will have new nuclear weapons that other countries do not and will not have.
0114_WBL0498	It is rumored that North Korea has at least a couple nuclear weapons.
0450_WBL0516	All this is highly unlikely, as with most al-Qaeda crackpot schemes.
0315_WBL0532	Response: Iraq is actually hostile territory for al-Qaeda, and without Iraqi sympathizers it can not succeed there.
0083_WBL0545	The clerics demanded talks with local US commanders.
0104_WBL0554	The US troops fired into the hostile crowd, killing 4.
0168_WSJ0058	Many have raised cash levels, which act as a buffer against steep market declines.
0722_WSJ0067	Also, persistent redemptions would force some fund managers to dump stocks to raise cash.
0068_WSJ0068	But a strong level of investor withdrawals is much more unlikely this time around, fund managers said.
0948_WSJ0101	She added, "If they all were bullish, I'd really be upset."
0385_WSJ0108	"The projects are big.

0244_WSJ0166	Meanwhile, Brazil is expected to increase its allowance from the 1.43% share it has had in recent years.
0215_WSJ0167	The EC and Japan  - the U.S.'s largest steel suppliers  - haven't been filling their quotas to the full extent.
0642_WSJ0171	But its quota has been as high as 6.9% in 1984.
0192_WSJ0188	"They don't want to get caught again," says one industry watcher.
0652_WSJ0193	The company introduced a superconcentrated Lemon Cheer in Japan after watching the success of Attack.
0424_WSJ0194	When Attack hit the shelves in 1987, P&G's share of the Japanese market fell to about 8% from more than 20%.
0968_WSJ0200	But the product, which wasn't as concentrated as the new Cheer, bombed in a market test in Denver and was dropped.
0020_WSJ0202	But P&G contends the new Cheer is a unique formula that also offers an ingredient that prevents colors from fading.
0059_WSJ0215	They expected a new barrage of demands that Japan do something quickly to reduce its trade surplus with the U.S..
0591_WSJ0241	"But I am relieved to see that you are beautiful and gentle and intelligent and a person of integrity."
0762_WSJ0252	The units that filed the suit are Southeastern Newspapers Corp. and Florida Publishing Co.
0830_WSJ0270	Beginning in mid-1987, prices began accelerating as a growing U.S. economy and the weak dollar spurred demand.
0741_WSJ0277	In addition, crude oil prices were up some from a year earlier, further pressuring profitability.
0750_WSJ0279	During the 1988 second half, many companies posted record gasoline and chemical profits.
0761_WSJ0290	"We've been very disappointed in the performance of natural gas prices," said Mr. Cox, Phillips's president.
0062_WSJ0292	Going into the fourth quarter, natural gas prices are anywhere from 8% to 17% lower than a year earlier.
0529_WSJ0300	Olivetti reportedly began shipping these tools in 1984.
0073_WSJ0303	President Bush called his attention to the matter during the Italian leader's visit here last week.
0239_WSJ0316	Officials at Drexel said they hadn't seen the suit and thus couldn't comment.
0169_WSJ0322	However, the agreement was canceled in June 1984.
0867_WSJ0333	And they're likely to stay that way for months to come, analysts say.
0790_WSJ0344	Until then, limited stocks are likely to keep prices near the $4-a-bushel level, analysts say.
0922_WSJ0350	Ferruzzi has denied it was trying to manipulate the soybean futures market.

0764_WSJ0422	The company asked for a 15-day extension Sept. 30, when the financial reports were due.
0257_WSJ0444	Now, GM appears to be stepping up the pace of its factory consolidation to get in shape for the 1990s.
0114_WSJ0453	The shutdowns will idle about 3,000 Canadian assembly workers and about 2,500 workers in Ohio.
0733_WSJ0458	That announcement left union officials in Van Nuys and Oklahoma City uncertain about their futures.
0881_WSJ0470	Weatherford said market conditions led to the cancellation of the planned exchange.
0268_WSJ0491	"Without official knowledge of sex or death, we flirted with both," she writes.
0077_WSJ0492	She analyzed families by their sleeping arrangements.
0088_WSJ0511	But it doesn't take too many lines to figure Harry out.
0626_WSJ0532	"This further confuses retailers," she says.
0505_WSJ0544	Hardest hit are what he calls "secondary" sites that primarily serve neighborhood residents.
0000_WSJ0555	By contrast, rentals in the best retail locations in Boston, San Francisco and Chicago rarely top $100 a square foot.
0523_WSJ0574	Justices Brennan and Stevens appear philosophical about it; Justices Marshall and Blackmun appear fighting mad.
0381_WSJ0606	In these four, for instance, the RTC is stuck with $4.51 billion in bad assets.
0315_WSJ0616	NCNB will acquire University Federal Savings Association, Houston, which had assets of $2.8 billion.

0104_WSJ0643	Besides, Time executives think selling a news magazine with a clock radio is tacky.
0419_WSJ0658	Both magazines are expected to announce their ad rates and circulation levels for 1990 within a month.
0181_WSJ0663	Its niche as the "network of record" during major crises draws elite audiences around the world.
