DUN1400	Lesley Monk, a 51-year-old from Burnley, explains to Mark MacKenzie why she and her team of huskies are going flat out to conquer the wastes of Alaska. 
DUN1401	While you are reading this, Lesley Monk is taking her dogs for a walk. 
DUN1402	Sixteen of them in fact, and not just for a quick once-round-the-park. 
DUN1403	All being well, the 51-year-old personal trainer from Lancashire is now one day into an 1,100- mile trek across the frozen Alaskan wilderness, the only British competitor in this year's Iditarod, the most demanding dog-sled race on earth. 
DUN1404	While the winner of an event billed as 'The Last Great Race in the Last Great Place' will be sipping victory champagne in front of a roaring fire inside of 10 days, Lesley and the other 67 mushers can expect several weeks on the trail, which will push them to the limits of their endurance. 
DUN1405	Polar bears, fragile river-ice and temperatures regularly below -60C are just some of the optional extras on a tour itinerary that requires sleep on the move as well as hours spent massaging weary canine shoulders and feet. 
DUN1406	The race takes its name from the village of Iditarod, one of 26 checkpoints along the way as competitors race from Anchorage in the east of the state to Nome in the west, a rerun of an historic journey. 
DUN1407	In 1925, a Nome doctor wired Anchorage pleading for medicine for an outbreak of diptheria. 
DUN1408	With no other transport available, teams of mushers transported the serum in a dramatic relay across the frozen tundra. 
DUN1409	The patient was saved and, conveniently for the logo writers, the legend was born. 
DUN1410	None of which explains how, for the third time in 14 years, a former hairdresser with a dysfunctional lung finds herself racing some of the hardiest backwoodsmen in North America across their own back yard. 
DUN1411	Lesley's first encounter with a husky, Alaska's working dog, was with one owned by a friend she was visiting in New York in the mid-Eighties. 
DUN1412	'In England, we were living on a farm in a highly touristy area,' she explains, 'On holiday, we were greeted by this gentle dog that looked incredibly fierce.' 
DUN1413	Deciding huskies were an excellent way to dissuade tourists from wandering up their drive, Lesley and her husband, Roy, tracked down a breeder in Britain. 
DUN1414	'The breeder explained the husky was a working dog, and only let me take one away on condition that I worked it. 
DUN1415	Three times a week, I would drive to the outskirts of Leeds and run the dog with a team behind a cart.' 
DUN1416	The Monks' obsession with the highly intelligent breed saw their canine family swell to 20 and eventually led them to Alaska and, via smaller qualifying races, to Lesley's first Iditarod in 1988. 
DUN1417	'I was a total rookie and was pretty overwhelmed by the whole thing,' she says. 
DUN1418	'I had one absolute dread, that I'd finish last and be out there in the wilderness all on my own.' 
DUN1419	Which is precisely what happened. 
DUN1420	Nineteen days after leaving Anchorage, having struggled to cope with the pace and physical demands of the race, Lesley crossed the finish line to claim the Red Lantern, the wooden spoon. 
DUN1421	'I was devastated to finish so far back and I loathe talking about getting the Red Lantern. 
DUN1422	But with hindsight it was the best thing that could have happened, because now on the trail, there are very few things that phase me.' 
DUN1423	Her disappointment over her 1988 placing emphasises the fiercely competitive nature of the event. 
DUN1424	Lesley's next outing was in 1990, when she was forced to scratch after her sled and team went through thin ice attempting a river crossing. 
DUN1425	'The water was only thigh deep, but my sled sank and the dogs were in the water, getting tangled up in their gang lines. 
DUN1426	The problem was compounded by the following teams, who were jumping over us to get across and were getting tangled themselves.' 
DUN1427	While Lesley insists there is camaraderie between the mushers, competitors will only come to another's aid if a situation is life-threatening. 
DUN1428	Given that leading racers have also been known to confuse the chasing pack by removing trail markers as they pass, this clearly isn't the London 
DUN1429	Marathon. But then $50,000 (35,000) in prize money is a hefty sum in outback Alaska. 
DUN1430	And bearing in mind that only four of this year's field are of Alaskan descent, $50,000, it seems, is a lot money everywhere else. 
DUN1431	The Iditarod was first raced competitively in 1974, when it was won by Dick Wilmarth in 20 days. 
DUN1432	Around a dozen dogs died through exhaustion, the result of poor nutrition. 
DUN1433	Races since have had huge teams of vets, and the death rate has fallen to below four dogs per thousand. 
DUN1434	While the Humane Society of the US have been trying to get the race banned for many years, race vets rightly contend that the death rate is about equal to that in a sedentary canine population. 
DUN1435	And animal welfare has certainly progressed from centuries past, when native Alaskans tethered husky bitches in woodland to mate with local wolves. 
DUN1436	If the wolf chose to mate with, rather than eat, his blind date, the outcome would be a litter of working dogs with a wild toughness. 
DUN1437	'All the attention is focused on the dogs and nobody really cares about you,' Lesley explains. 
DUN1438	'The rules state that the sled must have the capacity to carry an injured dog under cover, as well as demanding one compulsory 24-hour rest and two eight-hour breaks at checkpoints. 
DUN1439	These are on top of the camp breaks we take out on the trail. 
DUN1440	People who don't know these animals have no idea what they are capable of. 
DUN1441	Their speed and stamina are breathtaking, and if you get the right balance of personalities in your team, you can really fly.' 
DUN1442	While the demands on the dogs are immense, the demands on the mushers are equally daunting. 
DUN1443	'If the team is down for eight hours, the dogs are resting, but you're constantly working, rubbing ointment into cuts on feet, massaging joints, preparing food,' says Lesley. 
DUN1444	'When you set off, you're exhausted and the dogs want to run like the wind.' 
DUN1445	And the treats in store back on the trail are many. 
DUN1446	Mushers need tremendous aerobic fitness to be able to scoot, skateboard style, with one leg on the sled for long distances. 
DUN1447	Should conditions become sticky, scooting turns to old-fashioned running to maintain the most prized weapon in the musher's armoury, momentum. 
DUN1448	Standing still for extended periods also places tremendous strain on the arms and back, and should you take your eye off the trail at the wrong moment, you could wind up with a smack in the chops from an overhanging branch. 
DUN1449	And unless your screams carry across miles of wilderness, you're in trouble. 
DUN1450	Yet despite the hazards, Lesley is undaunted. 
DUN1451	'I keep going back because I love it,' she says. 
DUN1452	Shopping, sure, but culture? 
DUN1453	Can this Gulf state offer anything other than golf courses and gold souks? 
DUN1454	Wake up to a different view. 
DUN1455	It is early in the morning. 
DUN1456	I look out of the window and see below me the clear, calm turquoise waters of the Gulf. 
DUN1457	Above me, the sky is already pale blue. 
DUN1458	Between the turquoise and the pale blue, a haze of mother of pearl wreaths the city that stretches out from the shore in the pale, silky colours of an expensive negligee. 
DUN1459	The spires and towers of Dubai's astonishing architecture stretch up out of the mist like some fantastic palace from the Arabian Nights. 
DUN1460	Even what I later discover is an industrial installation looks like a fairytale fortress in this light. 
DUN1461	It's difficult to believe that it won't melt away, like a mirage, or a vision. 
DUN1462	Vision. 
DUN1463	It's a key word here. 
DUN1464	Modern Dubai exists, you will be told, thanks to the vision of Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum, the father of the present ruler, Sheikh Maktoum. 
DUN1465	His farsightedness created a Gulf state that is no longer dependent on the profits from oil but is a world centre of business and trade. 
DUN1466	Dubai's visions come on a grand scale and they take physical shape with remarkable speed. 
DUN1467	You want two man-made islands shaped like palm trees, each with 40 miles of coastline, housing 40 hotels, 2,000 luxury villas, etc, etc, etc? 
DUN1468	Construction begins next year. 
DUN1469	You want to turn a shopping mall into an entire city, complete with parks, children's playgrounds, hotels and apartments? 
DUN1470	Consider it done. 
DUN1471	My vantage point for this dawn view of the city is a 361 metre (1,184 feet) high hotel, shaped like a boat and looking like a spinnaker. 
DUN1472	It rises from the sea on a man-made island, while a second hotel, shaped like a cresting silver breaker, lies like a bow wave beneath it. 
DUN1473	This is the seven-star Burj Al Arab. 
DUN1474	Completed only three years ago, it is already an icon. 
DUN1475	It deserves iconic status, I think. 
DUN1476	It's a beautiful building, almost organic in feel once you are inside, with its layers of floors rising up, tier upon tier, like the interior of a beehive or a strange seed pod. 
DUN1477	At the top is what looks from a distance like a glass envelope, the Al Muntaha restaurant, with its stunning views across the Gulf, while below the hotel, accessed by a 'submarine ride' lift, is the Al Mahara seafood restaurant, whose walls encase vast aquaria. 
DUN1478	To say that the interior of the Burj is lavishly exotic is like saying that Coco Chanel designed the odd suit. 
DUN1479	It is quite startlingly luxurious. 
DUN1480	There are no rooms, only suites, of which mine was a very lowly variety. 
DUN1481	It was about as big as my Edwardian terraced house (just a one-bedroom suite, you understand). 
DUN1482	The bathroom toiletries are Herms and you get given bottles and bottles of the stuff. 
DUN1483	(You can tell who's been staying at the Burj: they trail around in a cloud of 24 Faubourg.) 
DUN1484	Everything is done by remote control, including summoning the butler. 
DUN1485	Ours was called Francis, and he carefully explained how to use the interactive controls to open and close the curtains and so on. 
DUN1486	Of course, I forgot all this the minute he left the room and spent about half an hour trying to open the living-room curtains. 
DUN1487	Eventually, I retired upstairs to bed to find that I'd opened the bedroom curtains instead. 
DUN1488	The bedroom was so far away (up an impressive curved marble staircase, past a gigantic chandelier) that I couldn't hear the hum of the mechanism. 
DUN1489	The Burj was a fabulous experience. 
DUN1490	I'm ashamed to say that I felt a tiny twinge of guilty relief when I transferred to the Jumeirah Beach Hotel. 
DUN1491	This is the one that looks like a cresting silver wave and it's a very jolly place, full of very jolly families doing very jolly beach holiday things. 
DUN1492	The beach waiters even offer to clean your sunglasses for you and there is not a lager lout within 1000 miles. 
DUN1493	(As for the curtains, they are operated by the usual pulley mechanism.) 
DUN1494	Bliss. 
DUN1495	It is early in the morning. 
DUN1496	The sun is rising vast and red through the murk of an incipient sandstorm. 
DUN1497	I'm on my way to the Oasis stables, near the Nad Al Sheba racecourse. 
DUN1498	Suddenly, on the outskirts of this City of Gold, I see the ancient currency of Arabia making its majestic way across the sands. 
DUN1499	Camels. 
DUN14100	Scores of them, some ridden by tiny boys, are heading for the camel racetrack, a circuit so vast I cannot see the other side or even each end. 
DUN14101	(When the race is in progress, the spectators have to follow it in a flotilla of four-wheel- drives.) 
DUN14102	We halt as the camel caravans cross the road ahead with that distinctive swaying camel gait. 
DUN14103	But if these are the sultans of swing, the thoroughbreds at Oasis are the sheikhs of the sport of kings, aristocrats whose bloodlines are as ancient as their owners'. 
DUN14104	The Oasis stables are part of the Godolphin racing empire, owned by the Maktoum brothers, Sheikh Rashid's sons. 
DUN14105	Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al-Maktoum is the prime mover in the enterprise, making history in the Nineties by overwintering his British-bred horses in Dubai and winning a string of classic victories. 
DUN14106	We are shown around the stables by trainer Nick Robb. 
DUN14107	Nick is a world expert on racehorses, but if he ever decided on an alternative career, he would make a good living as a tour guide. 
DUN14108	He's a natural. 
DUN14109	His audience is rapt as he outlines the science that goes into making a horse run from A to B in the fastest possible time. 
DUN14110	At the end of the stables tour, we are taken to the racetrack to see the grandstand and tour the jockeys' quarters and the stewards' room. 
DUN14111	This is where the Dubai World Cup, the world's richest horse race, will be run on 23 March. 
DUN14112	Entry to race meetings is free, and there's no gambling. 
DUN14113	But who needs a bet when you can watch the result of centuries of Arab equine expertise come thundering down the track? 
DUN14114	It is early in the morning. 
DUN14115	A falcon hangs in the sky high above the desert before stooping in a heart-stopping dive for its reward. 
DUN14116	Here and there, Arabian oryx nibble the shrubby plants that form defiant grey mats in the sand. 
DUN14117	I bend down and rub the leaves between my fingers. 
DUN14118	To my English gardening hands they feel bereft of any moisture or goodness. 
DUN14119	But Mitch, our South African field guide, assures me that the oryx thrive on their diet and points to where tiny yellow flowers have bloomed, a response to a short-lived shower the night before. 
DUN14120	Falconry is an Arab tradition: the birds are pictured on the Dubai currency, the dirham. 
DUN14121	In his book Arabian Sands, about Oman and the Empty Quarter, the explorer Wilfred Thesiger describes hunting bustard with peregrine falcons on camelback, accompanied by a pack of salukis. 
DUN14122	He tells how an Arab falconer could have a bird ready to hunt in a fortnight to three weeks. 
DUN14123	At the Al Maha, they have both peregrine and saker falcons and the birds are fed on quail bought from the supermarket. 
DUN14124	'The guests don't really want to see things being killed,' Mitch says drily. 
DUN14125	Al Maha means 'oryx' and the resort is another vision made reality. 
DUN14126	Set in 10 square miles of desert nature reserve, it is designed to resemble a Bedouin encampment. 
DUN14127	Even the oryx have appeared as if by the wave of a wand: reintroduced after being hunted to extinction. 
DUN14128	(Thesiger doesn't like the term Bedouin; he says it's a double plural and the correct term is Bedu. 
DUN14129	He and his 'Bedu', of course, accounted for quite a few oryx.) 
DUN14130	The general manager, Tony Williams, is a South African ecologist who believes, refreshingly, that the secret of running a successful hotel is good manners. 
DUN14131	'You should treat people as if they were a guest in your house,' he says. 
DUN14132	Each guest chalet is arranged to give maximum privacy, with its own deck and plunge pool. 
DUN14133	The interiors are luxurious, but they are as understated as the Burj Al Arab is spectacular. 
DUN14134	There's no Harrods-on-ecstasy glitz here, but a wooden easel in the corner, complete with paper and pastels. 
DUN14135	It would be wrong to imply that you don't receive a warm welcome elsewhere in Dubai. 
DUN14136	At all the hotels, regardless of their architectural idiosyncrasies, there is smiling courtesy. 
DUN14137	Even in the Emirates Towers Hotel, a tall, sharp pencil of a building that seems to encapsulate in glass and steel Dubai's go-getting, onward-thrusting character, the service is unfailingly friendly. 
DUN14138	However and I'm sorry to labour the Arabian Nights analogy there is something magical about the Al Maha. 
DUN14139	It has something to do with the pace of life, the change of focus. 
DUN14140	Apparently, many people come here for only one or two nights. 
DUN14141	I was told, before I came, that I wouldn't want to spend more than a night as 'there is nothing to do'. 
DUN14142	I easily could have spent a week at Al Maha. 
DUN14143	Hell, I could have spent a year. 
DUN14144	Before dinner, I sat on the terrace and watched dusk fall over the desert. 
DUN14145	The dry fragrance of frankincense, from an incense burner nearby, lingered on the warm, still night air. 
DUN14146	If only Herms could capture that and put it in a bottle.
